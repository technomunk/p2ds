# Goal

## Intro

Hello and welcome to Technomunk's diary! I (Technomunk) will try to keep a consistent record of my thoughts and feeling about this project.

I have worked in game-dev for a couple of years, but moved onto other software development. But the desire to create something interactive in real time never really died. So it was channelled into this little project.

## Vision

The goal is to learn about *real-time interactive physics simulation*. I don't like following tutorials, as the problems they present feel unnatural and when trying to apply seemingly learned lessons to "real" problems the gaps show up. So a ground-up project it is then.

To minimize effort I will stick to 2D. This allows to easily work out problems on a flat paper and minimize amount of stuff that needs to be processed to be visually stimulating (1'000s of entities rather than 10'000s).

Finally I want to explicitly handle any and all edge cases, so I want to stick to fixed point (integer) arithmetic for the whole of physics and avoid "oh it seems to work" fallacy of floating point logic.
